# Challenge 2 - Explorer
Second challenge of a web programming course, this was an extra one!

-This challenge asked to study a Figma project and make a code from scratch trying to reproduce it. It was definitely harder than the last one, but for sure it made me learn a lot more about html/css coding.
-I also noticed it's really hard to make it look like 100% of the original one, but I tried my best!
-And also added links to the words "Destinos" "Ofertas" "Contato" because they wouldn't make any sense to just be there and not be a link.

-How it looked on Figma:
